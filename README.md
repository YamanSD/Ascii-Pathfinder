# Ascii Maze

This is a pathfinding algorithms visualizer written in Python using the Pygame library. The program allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms on a map represented by ASCII characters. It supports both randomly generated maps and reading maps from files.

## Features

- ASCII Map Representation: The program uses ASCII characters to represent the map, making it easy to understand and visualize.
- Randomly Generated Maps: You can generate random maps of different sizes to test the pathfinding algorithms.
- Map File Support: You can read maps from files, allowing you to use custom maps for visualization.
- Pathfinding Algorithms: The visualizer implements the following pathfinding algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A-Star (A*)
  - Variations of A-Star

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
